[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soar-telescope/dragons-soar.svg?branch=auto_test)](https://travis-ci.org/soar-telescope/dragons-soar)

This repository contains the parameters, primitives and recipes to 
reduce data obtained with the instruments existing at the SOAR 
Telescope using the 
[DRAGONS framework](https://github.com/GeminiDRSoftware/DRAGONS).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the DRAGONS team for helping our group in getting
involved with [DRAGONS framework](https://github.com/GeminiDRSoftware/DRAGONS)
by adding initial instrument modules and by adding initial primitive 
files to be used as example.
